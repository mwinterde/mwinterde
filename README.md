### Hi, my name is Marcus ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a self-taught Data Scientist who loves to learn new data analysis and machine learning concepts
* I'm currently using this profile primarily as a personal learning space, but feel free to see if there is something interesting for you
* I'm currently doing most of my work on the Google Cloud Platform and love easy-to-use tools like dbt, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn or streamlit
